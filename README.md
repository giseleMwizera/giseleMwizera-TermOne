This is my calculator app that has been developed with frontend using reactjs and backend using springboot

## How to run

**Firstly, clone it**

```
> $ git clone git@github.com:giseleMwizera/giseleMwizera-TermOne.git
```

**Secondly, cd into the client directory to install used packages**

```
> $ cd client
> $ npm install

```
**Thirdly, cd to the server directory and deploy the server*

```
> $ cd backend
> $ mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Lastly, cd to the client directory and run the the client*
As it has been initialised using vite, I am using vite as a devDependency

```
> $ cd ../client
> $ npm run dev
```
